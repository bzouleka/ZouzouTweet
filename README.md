# Rebuild Twitter with Laravel

Perhaps you have completed the courses like [PHP with Laravel for beginners — Become a Master in Laravel](https://www.udemy.com/php-with-laravel-for-beginners-become-a-master-in-laravel/) or [Laravel From Scratch](https://laracasts.com/series/laravel-5-from-scratch). You’ve learned the basics of Laravel.

Now what?

You want to build something bigger than a basic CRUD app.

Let’s say building a blog. You’ve learned how to create a post, update it, and delete it. Now you want to know how to build the user account, who can create a post that available to other users who want to view it. You want to know what’s the best practices with the naming conventions for routes.

I am going to cover those topics in this Rebuild Twitter with Laravel.

Follow along and together we’ll build an interesting app, at the same time, develop your skills and be ready to change the world.

Here is what we are going to do.

We’ll rebuild the famous social network, Twitter from scratch. Please bear in mind that this is a project for learning, the outcome is not exactly same as the actual Twitter website. We are learning by rebuilding the key features in our own way.

These are the key features of the Twitter that we are going to rebuild,
* User
* Follow/Unfollow
* Tweet/Retweet
* Timeline
